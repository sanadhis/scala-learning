# Chapter 3
Some next steps into Scala

# Points
* Scala val will point to the same object (allocation in memory). But the object to which it refers to could potentially still be changed. Ex: Array allocation is immutable but the array element itself is mutable.
* No operator overloading in Scala -> Operators can be used as method names.
* Array access is apply (method) access -> parentheses instead of square brackets.
